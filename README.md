# Noto fonts

Noto’s goal is to provide a beautiful reading experience for all languages. It is a free, professionally-designed, open-source collection of fonts with a harmonious look and feel in multiple weights and styles. All Noto fonts are published under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL) v1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL), which allows you to copy, modify, and redistribute them if you need to.

For background, technical details, and how to contribute, see the [EN FAQ](FAQ.md) or [KR FAQ 자주 묻는 질문](FAQ-KR.md).

## 2021.03.24

This is work in progress - we have published an update to Greek codepoints in NotoSans. Similar changes will arrive between now and end of 2021 to all Latin Greek Cyrillic Noto fonts. For changes please see [NotoSans update](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-source/blob/main/WIP-GRK/20210310-NotoSans-MM.pdf). In other files in https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-source/blob/main/WIP-GRK/ you'll find various update details. The next update, to NotoSansDisplay will arive in early April.

## 2021.02.28

We have recompiled all the existing sources with a new version of the fontmake compiler. The released fonts have the same version, and virtually are the same (but compilation date) as the fonts which were released previously. Therefore, there's no need to update anything if you track the fonts in this repository.
